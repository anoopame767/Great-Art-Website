				<p>Great Art was started by Hubert Humperdinck when he was a schoolboy in Nelson in 1975, 
				although it didn't have a name then. Hubert had an art teacher who would regularly bring artworks 
				to school to show the pupils. The teacher would talk passionately about the different pieces of art. 
				She showed the pupils how the artworks were created and discussed their possible meaning and what 
				she felt the artists were conveying. Hubert was hooked. He started to look around for artworks 
				to collect for himself.</p>

				<p>Initially, he found artworks here and there in old second-hand shops or by visiting 
				elderly ladies and offering to value their artworks for them. One day he found a 
				particularly nice work by a New Zealand artist called Colin McKenzie. He took it to a 
				gallery to have it valued and was pleasantly surprised to find it was worth about ten 
				times as much as he had paid for it. He sold it to the gallery on the spot. This gave him 
				the idea that he could buy and sell art to build his collection.</p>

				<p>Around this time Hubert came up with his main idea: he would make it a principle when 
				he sold a piece of art to use the proceeds to buy two pieces to replace it. In this way 
				his collection would grow quickly. He wanted to balance this with collecting work by 
				artists with established reputations or ones who were up and coming, so that he could 
				build a quality collection. So, he has searched far and wide for the right pieces of art 
				to acquire.</p>

				<p>In 1999 Hubert decided to make art collecting his main focus. He established his 
				company, Great Art, and has been collecting art full-time ever since. Currently, he has 
				hundreds of pieces of art, including many that are considered to be significant works. 
				The idea came to him that it would be wonderful to be able to share his artworks with 
				people from around the world, so he has started this website, which showcases the art he 
				has collected.</p>
