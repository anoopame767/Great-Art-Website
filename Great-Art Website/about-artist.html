						<br>
						
						<h3>Early Years</h3>
						<p>Abstract painter and collage artist Lee Krasner was born Lena Krassner on 
						October 27, 1908, in Brooklyn, New York. Growing up, she liked to be called 
						Lenore, and later shortened the nickname to Lee, while also removing the second
						"s" from her last name.<br>
						Krasner's parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants who fled to the United States 
						to escape anti-Semitism and the Russo-Japanese War. Krasner was the youngest of 
						six children, and the only one of her siblings to be born in the United States. 
						When she was 14, she enrolled at Washington Irving High School in New York City, 
						where she was able to study studio art. When she graduated from high school in 
						1925, Krasner was awarded a scholarship to attend the Women's Art School of 
						Cooper Union. Following her graduation from Cooper Union, Krasner pursued yet 
						more art education at the illustrious National Academy of Design, completing her 
						course load there in 1932.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>WPA Artist</h3>
						<p>Krasner had the misfortune of graduating in the midst of the Great Depression. 
						To support herself, she took what work she could find, including modeling and 
						waitressing. Despite her early career challenges, Krasner didn't give up her 
						dream of making it as a full-time artist.<br>
						In 1934, Krasner was given good reason to believe her dream could become a 
						reality. She landed a job painting murals for the Works Progress Administration's 
						Public Works of Art Project. Thanks to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal art 
						program, Krasner was able to work fairly steadily for the WPA's Federal Art 
						Project up until 1943, when the agency was dissolved.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Studying Under Hoffmann</h3>
						<p>In 1937, while she was still working for the WPA, Krasner decided to pursue 
						more art training at the 8th Street atelier run by renowned German artist Hans 
						Hoffmann. Through her exposure to Hoffmann's modernist theories, her formerly 
						naturalist paintings and drawings took on a cubist approach and reached a new 
						level of sophistication. Her involvement in the New York art scene extended to 
						include political causes. To this end, Krasner joined the American Abstract 
						Artists, which afforded her more opportunities to exhibit her work as a burgeoning
						young modernist painter. Krasner's association with Hoffmann's atelier lasted 
						through 1940.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Marriage to Pollock</h3>
						<p>In 1941, Krasner became involved with fellow artist Jackson Pollock. The pair 
						had met once years earlier, but this time around love bloomed between them. The 
						two were married in 1945, after which they moved to East Hampton, Long Island. 
						Krasner became a champion for Pollock's work. She also found some inspiration in 
						his intuitive artistic style for her own work. Krasner was also deeply influenced 
						by Henri Matisse and Piet Mondrian. In the late 1940s, Krasner produced her Little
						Image series.<br>
						As her marriage to Pollock unraveled and his alcoholism escalated, Krasner 
						moved on to experimenting with multimedia collages such as "Milkweed" (1955). She 
						held an exhibition of these collages in New York City in 1955. The following year, 
						Krasner had to cope with the death of Pollock after he was killed in a 
						drunk-driving accident. She was away in Paris when he crashed his car near the 
						couple's farm. Struggling with her grief, Krasner refocused on her first passion, 
						painting. She channeled her sadness and rage into a range of works. During this 
						time, Krasner created her Earth Green and Night Journey series.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Later Work and Death</h3>
						<p>In the early 1960s, Krasner was living back in Manhattan when she nearly died 
						of a brain aneurysm. After a two-year recovery period, Krasner returned to 
						refining nature-inspired works. She lived in the shadow of her late husband for 
						much of her career, but she did receive some notice for her work during her 
						lifetime. In 1965 she had a retrospective solo exhibition at the Whitechapel 
						Gallery in London, later followed by a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of 
						American Art in 1975.<br>
						In poor health during her final years, Krasner was able to attend the first solo 
						retrospective show of her career held in America. The traveling exhibit debuted 
						at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts in 1983. Krasner died of diverticulitis on June
						19, 1984, in New York City.</p>
